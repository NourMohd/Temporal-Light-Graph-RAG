            "Chunk Text: CNN —  As President Donald Trump attempts to muscle his GOP agenda through a narrow House majority, Rep. Chip Roy is perhaps the most important holdout to win over. He may also be the toughest.  Speaker Mike Johnson and his team have been confident they can pass Trump’s massive reconciliation bill, because they don’t believe any Republican will want to stand in the way and face Trump’s wrath. But Roy, the unapologetic fiscal hawk, is the rare GOP lawmaker willing to publicly challenge the president. He has already survived multiple calls by his own party to oust him — including from Trump himself.  “Chip Roy has got courage,” said Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who has worked behind the scenes with Roy to force party leaders to seek deeper cuts in the legislation. Asked why few other Republicans are willing to speak up against Trump’s bill, Norman said: “A lot of them are more interested in coming back to Congress and doing whatever it takes to appease each little group.”  Roy, a\n",
